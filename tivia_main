• PAYOUT:
  Your payout depends on how many questions you get right!, each question is worth
  $1.
  EXAMPLE: I chose to answer 5 questions, I got 3 questions correct but 2 
           incorrect. My end payout would be $3

• QUESTIONS:
  Questions in this Trivia are related to our Solar System!
  MINIMUN Questions: 5
  MAXIMUN Questions: 15

• HINTS: 3 (MAX)
  If you are asked a question you dont completely know the answer to, you can type 
  "hint" and you will be given a related hint to that question.

• DOUBLE TROUBLE: 
- Double trouble is a endgame extension, where if you answer all questions 
  correctly, you will be asked if you want to enter "Double Trouble" mode. 
- In double trouble mode, you will answer the same related questions again (at 
  random) and recieve DOUBLE the amount of payout at endgame!. 

- Heres the catch, in double trouble you CANNOT use any hints. And if you answer a 
  question incorrectly, the program will end straight away - losing all your 
  money!.""")
